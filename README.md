# COVID-19-study
- A study of COVID-19 in Tunisia and Germany (scripts can be used for other countries.)
- The project a couple of scripts that helps scrape the COVID-19 cases, provided by  Johns Hopkins University (JHU CSSE).
- The scraped data can be manipulated and interesting visualization can be drawn describing the current state of the spread.
- The Data is fitted to a Logarithmic curve and a SIR model.


# Requirements
use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the project dependencies.


# Examples
A couple of examples are also available under the form of Jupyter-notebooks that provide a couple of visualizations of the situation:
- In the world
- In Tunisia
- In Germany
